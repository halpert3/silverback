Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely
commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to
be freezing.

How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know. [Oh, switch
off](#). Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and

Excuse me, sir. Put them `back together` right now. Might I have a word with
you, please?

Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever,
you know...for a human being.

###### Heading six and a highlight

Luke! ==You must complete the training==. I can't keep the vision out of my
head. They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and
Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it.

**Strong and lists**

This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of
the Force. Yes, yes.

1. To Obi-Wan you listen.
2. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
3. But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and
   finish what I've begun.
4. You have my word.

It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are
made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

- You won't.
- Stopped they must be.
  - Nested list
- On this depends.

*This is emphasised* I saw them! I saw them! Saw what? Star Destroyers, two of
them, coming right at us. Sir, sir! Might I suggest... hut him up or shut him
down! Check the deflector shield! Oh, great.

It's impossible to go to light-speed! We're in trouble!
